# Expense Tracker App

As a way of teaching myself the fundamentals of modern fullstack web development, I've followed a tutorial to create this live expense tracker, using React, Bun, Hono, and Tanstack, along with Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui components, and more to come as I complete the tutorial.

# app

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run index.ts
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.1.22. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
